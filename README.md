Timeline of the reported problem as investigated throughout the world
The literature survey references works that discuss the growth of IoT, its services, and FPGA implementations in monitoring systems.The block diagram illustrates the FPGA architecture, showcasing its components like I/O blocks, Configurable Logic Blocks (CLB), and interconnection wires. It also mentions the versatility of FPGA applications in cryptography, filtering, and communication encoding.The hardware description section introduces the LM35 temperature sensor, explaining its function and applications in different systems.System implementation details the use of Spartan3AN FPGA starter kit with LM35 temperature sensor, VHDL code for analog to digital conversion, and ESP8266 Wi-Fi module for wireless data transmission to a Wi-Fi modem.The conclusion reflects on the challenges faced in IoT applications and proposes FPGA as an alternative solution, particularly for temperature monitoring in various industries like food preservation.
2016: Ajay Rupani, Gajendra Sujediya, and others published "A Review of FPGA Implementation of Internet of Things" and "A Review of Technology Paradigm for IoT on FPGA". These reviews likely highlighted the growth and challenges of implementing IoT using FPGA technology.
